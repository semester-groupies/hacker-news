## About GitHub:
An organisation has been created to represent the team as one unit. "Semester Groupies"
The Main repository is called "hacker-news" and every team member has read and write access to that repo.

Start off by cloning the repository to a folder on your harddrive:
`git clone https://github.com/semester-groupies/hacker-news.git`

Move into the local repo on your machine:
`cd hacker-news/`

Before every branching, make sure to call:
`git pull`
to keep Master updated.

Branch off the Master branch to start working on your feature:
`git checkout -b <name_of_branch_see_naming_conventions> master`

Make sure that everything went ok:
`git branch`
Check that the asterisk on the left moved next to your newly created branch.
